Historically, this pump has operated without such heavy vibration. This abnormality was identified early in the morning, causing unplanned inspection and vibration analysis. Current, temperature, nozzle pressure, and flow rate were found to be within normal values.  * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Vibration Analysis and inspection as part of routine monitoring. * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * Unknown at this time. A complete analysis and inspection will be conducted. * CONSEQUENCES: * Continued operation under these conditions might result in pump damage or failure, reducing the reliability and efficiency of the system. * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Potential impact on normal operation. * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Abnormal pump vibration. * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Supervisor, Maintenance Team, Vibration Analyst * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Vibration Analyst, Maintenance Supervisor. * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is a first-time occurrence with this pump. * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * The pump was temporarily taken out of service.

Upon visual inspection, no visible factors like leaks or visible damage  were found that could cause such abnormality. Measurements taken showed an increase in vibration levels by 20% compared to normal operation. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Vibration monitoring of operating pumps, S4.OP.AB-CW-0012 *  * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN?: * The exact cause is unknown. The pump was serviced 6 months ago under work order 80238940. It is possible the balancing of the pump wasn't done properly. * * CONSEQUENCES: * Decreased pump efficiency, possible pump damage if the issue is not addressed timely. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Normal pump operation, can impact overall system performance * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Increased vibration levels in 34A pump than usual * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Maintenance Supervisor, Engineering team * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Jane Doe (Maintenance Supervisor), John Doe (Engineer) * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is the first incidence of abnormal vibration in 34A pump * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Engineering team to investigate the vibration issue, perform dynamic balancing if necessary. Maintenance team to carry out inspection for possible physical anomalies. * 09/12/2021 10:54:28 EMILY SMITH (INCIDENT) * The abnormal vibration seems to have been caused by \u001b[1;31mimbalance\u001b[0m. The pump was dynamically balanced and vibration levels returned to normal. The function of 34A pump has been successfully restored.\n",

The vibration monitor was reading at  60 mm/s, which is higher than normal operational levels. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Regular CW system inspection. * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * The root cause of the elevated vibration levels is currently not clear. However,  such incidents can be a result of operating conditions, or potential mechanical issues  like bearing damage or imbalance in the rotating parts. * * CONSEQUENCES: * High pump vibrations can lead to damage and reduced operational efficiency. Early detection helps in avoiding possible breakdowns. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Normal Operation * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Elevated vibration level from E4 Condenser Pump * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * The Maintenance Team, Operations Manager, System Engineer * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Lisa Parker, System Engineer, Maintenance Team * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is the first incident of noticeable vibration on E4 pump. * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * The pump was shutdown for immediate inspection and maintenance. If necessary,  parts will be replaced or adjustments made to reduce the vibration.  * 02/13/2019 09:25:30 LISA PARKER (INCIDENT) * The inspection identified \u001b[1;31mworn out bearings\u001b[0m as the cause of the vibration.  Bearings have been replaced and pump has been reassembled and put back into operation. The vibration levels are now within acceptable limits.\n",
