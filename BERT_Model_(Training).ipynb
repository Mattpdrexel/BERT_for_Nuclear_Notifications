Initial measurement showed 34 psig, which is lower than the average operating pressure of the pump. All necessary pressure checks were made  and potential leak points inspected. Noise and heat generation appear to be in normal range, but the decreased pressure could indicate an internal compromise in the pump or a problem in the supply line. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Regular monitoring and safety checks  * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * Cause currently unknown, suspect problem with supply line or internal pump damage. * * CONSEQUENCES: * Potential reduced pump efficiency, internal damage, and process disruption * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Normal operation, potential safety hazard * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Abnormally low pressure in the 18B Pump * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Supervisor, Maintenance Team, 4th Floor Control Room * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Maintenance Team, Pump Specialist Team * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, first time * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Isolate 18B Pump and investigate for internal damage or supply line obstructions. Repair or replacement may be required, pending investigation results.  * 03/16/2019 11:59:00 JAMES FRANKLIN (INCIDENT) * The preliminary investigation shows there may be debris buildup causing the noticeable  decrease in pump pressure. Further checks required to confirm.\n",

All parameters including temperature, flow rates, and vibration are within normal limits, but output is reduced. The generator alarm was not triggered because all parameters were within the limits, only observable through data analysis.  * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * S5.OP.GN-0002 Generator Monitoring and Analysis Procedure * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * Not certain, possibly due to an issue during the recent maintenance work, or a latent defect in the generator. * * CONSEQUENCES: * Reduction in power generation capacity, potentially reducing plant operational flexibility. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Generation targets * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Reduced output power * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Site manager, Maintenance Team, Operational Support Team * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Operational Support Team, Maintenance Team Lead * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is a unique condition. * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Have the maintenance team re-inspect and perform advanced diagnostics on the 5B Generator under work order 80230196. * 11/20/2020 15:31:52 JOHN DOE (INCIDENT) * The advanced diagnostics found loose connections on the excitation system, causing reduced performance.

The frequency, which is supposed to remain steady around 50 Hertz, showed rapid variations between 45 and 55 Hertz. This type of behavior is not typical of Pump 18A under normal operating conditions. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Regular System Monitoring, S4.OP-SO.CW-0006 * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * Initial assessments suggest the frequency fluctuation could either be caused by internal pump damage or malfunctioning of the electrical circuit associated with the pump. * * CONSEQUENCES: * Instability of the pump, risk of pump failure, potential impact on operational efficiency. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Operational Stability * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * High Frequency Fluctuation in Pump 18A. * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * On-duty Supervisor, Maintenance team * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Maintenance Team, Engineering Team, Supervisor * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is the first reported instance. * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Immediate action is to isolate and shut down pump 18A for detailed inspection. If the issue persists despite cleanup and basic fixes, a comprehensive investigation with the possibility of pump replacement should be considered. * 09/19/2018 08:43:17 ADAM BLACK * Post-inspection, it was found that the issue of the frequency fluctuation was due to minor internal damage.
