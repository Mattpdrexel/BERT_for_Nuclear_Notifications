The 30B pump was immediately shut down as per standby  protocol. Initial check did not reveal any visible damage or leaks.  Suspicion raised due to unusual vibrations that might indicate possible mechanical  issues or impending failure. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Regular operation and surveillance activities. * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * The exact cause is unknown at present. Likely causes could be misalignment,  an imbalance, worn parts or mechanical looseness. * * CONSEQUENCES: * Without prompt corrective action, ongoing pump operation could lead to more severe mechanical  damages or even catastrophic failure. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Equipment availability and reliability may be compromised if the pump fails. * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * High level of vibration from 30B pump. * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Supervisor, Maintenance team and Safety Department. * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Richard Adams, Maintenance team. * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is the first occurrence of such incident on this pump. * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Stop the pump and conduct detailed inspection. * 09/14/2020 15:43:26 RICHARD ADAMS (INCIDENT) * Inspection performed revealed misalignment of the pump and motor.

While not exceeding allowable limits, the figures are unusual compared to historical data available for this unit, and have the potential to contribute to faster wear and tear of the equipment. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Regular maintenance and vibration monitoring procedures followed as per S4.OP-SO.CW-0001. * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * The direct cause of the increased vibration is unknown. It may be due to imbalances in the pump or motor, or changes made during the maintenance activity. * * CONSEQUENCES: * If unchecked, increased vibration can lead to premature equipment damage or failure. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Normal pump operation that might need to be adjusted to compensate for increased vibration. * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Increased vibrations in the 17B Pump. * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Maintenance Supervisor, Vibration Analysis Team * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Maintenance Supervisor, Vibration Analysis Team Members * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No, this is the first observed instance for the 17B Pump. * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Vibration Analysis Team to investigate the cause of the increased vibrations and recommend the appropriate adjustment or repair as required. * 11/01/2019 10:20:21 JAMES DOE (INCIDENT) * Vibration analysis indicates harmonics from the motor may be causing the vibrations.

This is  an atypical condition for this unit, which was recently serviced during the maintenance  shutdown in April 2020. The vibration could be a sign of internal imbalance,  damaged components, or misalignment. * * ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, PROCEDURES INVOLVED: * Regular inspection and monitoring of equipment, namely S4.OP.SO.CW-0005. * * WHY DID CONDITION HAPPEN? * The exact cause of this vibration is yet unknown. It may be a result of overuse,  difficult operation conditions or an issue during the last service procedure. * * CONSEQUENCES: * Risk of damage to the motor if issue is not addressed. This could lead to unplanned  down-time and increased operating costs. * * REQUIREMENTS IMPACTED: * Regular operation and maintenance routine. * * ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS: * Excessive vibration in the 5B pump motor. * * WHO WAS NOTIFIED: * Supervisor, Maintenance Team, Incident Investigator * * KNOWLEDGEABLE INDIVIDUALS: * Laura Thompson, John Green, Sam Roberts * * REPEAT OR SIMILAR CONDITION: * No previous instances reported for this specific unit. However, occasional excessive  vibration issues have been noted fleet-wide on similar type motors. * * IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: * Recommended to halt use of the 5B Pump and carry out a thorough investigation,  including vibration analysis and internal inspection.
